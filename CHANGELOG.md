This is the first production version of the software. The most relevant features implemented are:
    - Calculation of hydromechanic coefficients (Freq Domain)
    - Calculation of first order wave exciting forces: diffraction and Froude-Krylov (Freq Domain)
    - Calculation of RAO operator (Freq Domain)
    - Calculation of second order wave exciting forces using two methods (Freq Domain):
        - Pinkster
        - Indirect
    - Calculation of wave relative height (Freq Domain)
    - Parallel execution using MPI (Freq Domain)
